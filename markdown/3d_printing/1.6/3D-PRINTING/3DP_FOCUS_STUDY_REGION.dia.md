# 3DP_FOCUS_STUDY_REGION [Public Dialog] {.title}

Package: [`3d-printing`](3D-PRINTING.pkg.md) (Nick name(s): `:3dp`) {.package}

Focus on a region of a mesh quality study by showing only items in a
 specified _region of interest_ (box) or with similar geometry.

 ![Study Region](images/focus_dia.png){.leftfloat}

 The dialog offers two complementary approaches for filtering down the measurement to a manageable
 size:
 * Bounding box based based filter. See options 2-9.
 * Filter similar face geometry. See options 10-13.

 While the dialog is active, both approaches can be used in an alternating way to interactively
 switch between box or geometry filtering.

 It might be handy to also load the original CAD model for reference, but it is not required.
 The study contains a copy of all relevant faces from the CAD model.

 ### Dialog Options

 1. A mesh study container generated by the dialog [`3DP_MEASURE_MESH_QUALITY`](3DP_MEASURE_MESH_QUALITY.dia.md) (Measure the quality of a mesh with respect to the part it was derived from).
    See option `:STUDY` below.

 Focus Region (By Box)
 :   Use part or assembly boxes to focus on a _region of interest_.

     2. One or more parts or assemblies from the _Measurements_ sub-assembly in the mesh
        quality study container associated with a mesh.
        The bounding box of the selected parts / assemblies define the region of interest
        to focus on. You can use the structure browser for selection, pick, or use the
        measurement browser (recommended). See the [Measurement Browser](#the-measurement-browser) section
        for more details. All parts from the mesh quality analysis which fully lie in the region of interest
        are drawn, all other parts are hidden. See option `:STUDY_PARTS` below.
        Parts not contained in the region of interest are hidded (see illustration item **14** for an
        example).
     3. The inflation amount for the region of interest. The amount is calculated by increasing the
        bounding box up to the size of the entire measurement result.
        This is used to add more context to your focus region.
        See option `:REGION_SIZE` below.
     4. Display filter to show/hide warning facets. See option `:SHOW_WARNINGS` below.
     5. Display filter to show/hide error facets. See option `:SHOW_ERRORS` below.
     6. Display filter to show/hide error facets. See option `:SHOW_MODEL` below.
     7. Display filter to show/hide the mesh. See option `:SHOW_MESH` below.
     8. Display filter to show/hide the feeback box of the region of interest.
        See option `:SHOW_BOX` below.
     9. Re-apply the region-of-interest filter.

 Filter Parts by Geometry
 :   Use geometric rules to focus on faces with similar geometry.

     10. A reference model face to be used as a template for finding faces with similar geometries.
         One a face has been selected geometry specific matching options appear.
     11. Show the number of matching geometries and to open the
         _Measurement Browser_ which is described in the next section.
         See option `:GEOMETRY_NUMBER` below.
     12. Reapply the geometry filter. See `:REAPPLY_RULE` below
     13. Clear the geometry rule based filter.

 #### The Measurement Browser {.unfloat}

 The measurements browser is activated by pressing the _Matches_ button_
 (see previous section). It shows measurement errors and warnings associated
 with model faces. Geometry filters, as described in the previous section, can be used to
 reduce the number of measurments shown in this dialog.

![Measurement Browser](images/MeasurementBrowser.png){.leftfloat}

 1. List of measurements associated with model faces.
     Select individual measurement rows to show error details in the _Mesh Errors_ pane **(2)**
     and focus on that measurement in the graphical display. The _area_ column
     shows the accumulated area of the measurements error facets so that insignificant mesh
     errors (tiny face areas) can be detected quickly.
 2. List of mesh error parts of the measurement selected in **(1)**. On selection
     the _region of interest_ is set to the chosen error. The CAD model face and the
     associated facets are then shown in the graphical display.
     The _area_ column
     shows the area of the individual groups of connected error facets
     so that insignificant mesh errors (tiny face areas) can be detected quickly.
